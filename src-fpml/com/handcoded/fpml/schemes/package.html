<p>Provides a framework for FpML scheme handling and a default XML file based
implementation for some 'controlled' domains.</p>
<p>FpML defines three types of domains for code values, namely 'closed', 'controlled'
and 'open'.</p>
<ul>
	<li>A 'closed' domain comprises of values which can be entirely enumerated today and
which are unlikely to need extending (e.g. days of the week, etc.). 'Closed'
domain values tend to be so fundamental that any change to them would require
a republishing of the FpML specification.</li>
	<li>A 'controlled' domain comprises of values where a standard set can be determined
for most users purposes but to which changes are allowed between FpML versions (e.g. 
currency code, documentation types, etc.) either for propriety reasons or due to a change
in market practice.</li>
	<li>An 'open' domain comprises of values which are impossible to predict (e.g.
unique message numbers) and/or is too large to enumerate (e.g. party or security codes).</li>
</ul>
<p>The Java archive containing the FpML related code contains two XML coded files for
the 'controlled' domains defined by FpML. An 'open' domain could be handled by deriving
a new class from <CODE>CachedScheme</CODE> that does a database lookup if the code is
not already cached.</p>
