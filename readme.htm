    <h1>
        Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        This document accompanies Java 1.9 release of the 'HandCoded Toolkit for FpML Processing'
        and describes the contents of the release area. The source code for this release
        is not included but is available from the SVN repository on SourceForge.</p>
    <h2>
        License</h2>
    <p>
        This toolkit is distributed under the terms if the 'Open Source License "OSL"&nbsp;
        Version 3.0'. A full copy of the license terms is included in the repository (click
        <a href="license.txt" target="_blank">here</a> to access) and must be distributed
        along with this file if you distribute this code to other parties.</p>
    <h2>
        Directory Structure</h2>
    <p>
        The ZIP file that contained this release expands into a number of files and sub-directories.
        The following briefly describes the purpose of each.
    </p>
    <ul class="L1">
        <li>readme.html (The file you are reading) </li>
        <li>license.txt<br />
            <br />
            A copy of the license terms under which the toolkit is distributed. </li>
        <li>handcoded.jar<br />
            <br />
            This file contains all compiled Java class files for the toolkit and its demonstration
            applications. </li>
        <li>Validate*.bat<br />
            <br />
            Running these files will execute a simple batch validation of a selection of FpML
            examples. Some of the example file distributed with FpML contain some mistakes and
            will output error messages. </li>
        <li>Classify*.bat<br />
            <br />
            Running these files will execute a simple program that uses the classification tools
            within the toolkit to identify the financial product within the example files.</li>
        <li>files-core &amp; files-fpml
            <br />
            Contains an XML catalog file (and its associated schema) used to resolve DTD system
            identifiers/schema namespace URIs to physical file locations and the business rule
            configuration file.
			<ul>
                <li>schemas<br />
                    <br />
                    Contains a subdirectory for each version of the FpML as well as the schema for digital
                    signatures. </li>
                <li>data<br />
                    <br />
                    A set of XML data files containing the scheme code values defined by FpML for each
                    release and a set of additional definitions for currency and country codes. </li>
                <li>examples<br />
                    <br />
                    A copy of the FpML example file for each schema release. Some may contain mistakes
                    as many have not been properly validated. </li>
                <li>test-cases<br />
                    <br />
                    A copy of the FpML validation test files for both valid and invalid case. It is
                    important to note some valid test cases still generate errors, just not the one
                    they are supposed to test.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>lib<br />
            <br />
            Contains a copy of the Xerces JAR images used by the example application. See the
            associated readme.txt file for version information.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		Example Applications</h2>
	<p>
		The toolkit is accompanied by some simple test scripts that demonstrates its functionality
		and performance.</p>
	<h3>
		Validation</h3>
	<p>
		The validation scripts (e.g. Validate5-9.bat, etc.) use a simple application (implemented
		as the class demo.com.handcoded.fpml.Validate) to process one or more XML files.
		Running one of the example batch files will process a small selection of FpML examples
		displaying the results to the screen.</p>
	<p>
		At the end of the run the program calculates the average processing time for
		each file and displays the number of rules tested against each file as shown below.</p>

	<p>
		The application responds to a number of command line options and can be configured
		to test the FpML defined rules (e.g. excludes HandCoded rules including scheme value
		checking) or to use a more streamlined XML parsing technique that only supports
		schema based instances from FpML 4.0 or later. The default configuration is to process
		both DTD and schema based instances which is less efficient.</p>
	<p>
		Futures releases will add further demonstration applications.</p>
