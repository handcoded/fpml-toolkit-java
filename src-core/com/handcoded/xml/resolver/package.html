Provides support for XML entity resolution through a XML catalog file.
<p>
The association between an XML instance document and its associated schemata
is made through namespace references. An instance document can provide a 'hint'
to the schema location for the parser but it is unlikely that any path contained
in the schemaLocation attribute will be valid both for the sender and the receiver.
<p>
The best approach to locating the schema for a namespace is to look it up in
a 'catalog' which holds either an explicit mapping or a set of rules for
transforming the namespace URI. This keeps an hardcoded system paths out
of the processing applications code base.
<p>
The original catalog format was created for SGML processing. A new standard
proposed by OASIS is more focussed on XML document processing and is implemented
by these classes.
<p>
A simple example of a catalog would be the following for the FpML schema.
